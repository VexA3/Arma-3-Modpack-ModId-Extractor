# Modpack Modid Extractor
This was a simple project I made to be able to quickly read modids from an Arma 3 modpack for users to be able to quickly add mods to their dedicated server.

# How to export a modpack

First, load the bare minimum of mods (don't include mods such as terrains or other mods that wont be used).

Next in the top right, click the preset button

Then click Save As and name the modpack

Next click the More... dropdown in the top left.
